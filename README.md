## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

- This Challenge was used to practice Grid.
- Keeping things simple
- I looked into selectors and pseudo classes to better understand the stylings Kevin Powell used in his video

### Continued development

As a beginner, I have a long way to go in my learning journey.
I am struggling to keep things simple and I find the more I know the more difficult it is to do so.
The only thing I can do is continue to practice.
